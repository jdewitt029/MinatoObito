         This is another poster that is inspired by my favorite moment in all of anime from the iconic show called Naruto. This work was actually one of the first attempts that I made trying to utilize the Adobe program Illustrator. I made everything in the poster besides the lower right and left characters, the flames, and the lightning. I wanted to better my skills in Illustrator so that I would not be limited to the images that I find on the internet that are not even the highest resolution. This skill of drawing in Illustrator helps my designs out so much because I have freedom to draw and create anything that I would like to try. After creating the vector images, I then took them to photoshop to compose them and add the different effects you see.
